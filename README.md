# Impact of Lifestyle and Physiological Factors on PCOS: A Statistical Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between **lifestyle choices, physiological markers, and the risk of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**. Using a Kaggle dataset with over 2,000 records and 44 variables, our analysis applied **exploratory data analysis (EDA), chi-square tests, correlation heatmaps, and logistic regression** to evaluate risk factors.

## 🔹 Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized BMI, TSH, blood pressure, AMH levels, and lifestyle factors.  
- **Chi-Square Tests:** Identified significant associations between PCOS and fast-food consumption, weight gain, and exercise habits.  
- **Logistic Regression:** Found **BMI** and **AMH levels** as statistically significant predictors of PCOS (p < 0.001).  
- **Correlation & Multicollinearity:** Verified low VIF (<1.05), ensuring predictor reliability.  
- **Conclusion:** Lifestyle factors (fast food, exercise, weight gain) appear stronger predictors than some hormonal factors.
